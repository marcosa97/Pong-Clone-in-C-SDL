# Pong-Clone-in-C-SDL

Author: Marcos Alcantar

My second game in C++ using the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) development library. 
Basic 1 Player Pong Clone for learning basic game design concepts.

This project depends on:
-SDL2 library
-SDL2_TTF extension library
-SDL2_Image extension library

I created all title screens in Photoshop CS6.
