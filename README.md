# Pong-Clone-in-C-SDL

Author: Marcos Alcantar

My second game in C++ (NOT C) using the SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer) development library. 
Basic 1 Player Pong Clone for learning basic game dev concepts.

This project depends on:
-SDL2 library
-SDL2_TTF extension library
-SDL2_Image extension library

You can see tutorials for SDL2 that I used here: http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php

## Build Prerequisites
You will need to install the SDL2 development library, the SDL_image extension, and OpenGL.

To install g++ compiler if you don't already have it:
```
$ sudo apt-get install --yes software-properties-common g++ make
```
To install sdl2:
```
$ sudo apt-get install --yes libsdl2-dev
```
To install opengl
```
$ sudo apt-get install --yes freeglut3-dev
```
To install sdl image extension
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
```
To install sdl ttf extension
```
$ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-ttf-dev
```

## Building and Running
When you have downloaded the files from this repository, navigate to the project directory 'Pong-Clone-in-C-SDL':
```
$ cd Pong
$ make
$ ./Pong.out
```

To delete the object files, run this command:
```
$ make clean
```

I created all title screens in Photoshop CS6.
